Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis Insights

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository contains documentation for Task 1 of my internship, which focuses on data cleaning, analysis, and uncovering meaningful patterns from datasets.

Task Overview

The objective of Task 1 was to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable—such as age or gender—within a given population.

Skills and Knowledge Gained

Through this task, I enhanced my skills in data visualization by learning how to effectively use bar charts and histograms. These tools help illustrate the distribution of categorical or continuous data, allowing for clearer interpretation of trends and insights within the dataset.
